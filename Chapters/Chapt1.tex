\section{Introduction}

Here is where you can put a general introduction to your thesis. Just start typing away! You won't be able to render each of your chapters individually, as they are missing the preamble (the bit before the \verb+\begin{document}+). Using Overleaf makes this simple, locally (i.e. your computer) it will only be a bit more tricky. 

One of my favorite features of \LaTeX{} is the ability to put comments in your document, that are not rendered into the PDF. I leave little notes to myself all the time. You will have noticed many of these already in the document. Anything that is prefixed with a \% sign will be ignored when creating a PDF. The \% sign is a special character in \LaTeX{} (there are others too), so to print it you have to ``escape it'' as such: \verb+\%+.

Quotes too a slightly different. Use the backtick (near your escape key) for the start and an apostrophe for the end of the quote. \verb+``''+. 

\section{Citations}
When you need to cite a paper, it is simple. For a regular citation \citep{wright1932roles}. Overleaf will even give you a drop down of possible references. For multiple citations, separate with a comma \citep{wright1932roles,haldane1922sex}. For multi-author citations, the \verb+et. al+ is automatically put in.

\section{a new section}

Other citation styles are called in a similar manner.
\begin{verbatim}
\citep{} = (Wright 2015)
\citet{} = Wright (2015)
\citealt{} = Wright 2015
\citealp{} = Wright, 2015
\end{verbatim}

Citations themselves are held in the .bib file. The first line defines the key, which is used to call the citation in the text (such as ``haldane1922sex''). You can change the key to whatever. Though there is not likely to be a reason for it, there are ways to have multiple bibliographies. Various packages, such as multibib and bibtopic, would allow you to do things like print bibliographies at the end of each chapter. 

With bibtopic you would have separate .bib files and then print them within a 
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{btSect}{Chapt1.bib}
	``some print command''
\end{btSect}.
\end{verbatim}

As for the citation style at the end in the references section, I believe the GSA says go with whatever is the ``standard'' in your field. That will take a little Google-ing to get right.

One nice feature is creating short names for species, and other acronyms. In the preamble of the main text, you can define these acronyms. They would look something like:
\begin{verbatim}
\DeclareAcronym{est}{
	short = EST,
	long  = expressed sequence tags
}

\DeclareAcronym{Xl}{
	short = \textit{X.~laevis},
	long  = \textit{Xenopus~laevis}
}
\DeclareAcronym{Xg}{
	short = \textit{X.~gilli},
	long  = \textit{Xenopus~gilli}
}
\end{verbatim}

These could allow you to write \ac{est} and \acl{Xl}, which will bring the full name the first time, then the short form all other times. So we can call them again \ac{est} and \ac{Xl}. We can even pluralize them \acp{est}, if necessary. For species names, I generally use \verb+\acl+ the first time, then \verb+\ac+ the other times. If I mention another species with the same genus name, such as \acs{Xg}, I use \verb+\acs+ the first time (so that I do not repeat the genera name) and all other time use \verb+\ac+. There are a lot of options, beyond ``short'' and ``long'', if you need more complicated things with your acronyms. 

Another option for odd names is to define a custom command. This is set with
\begin{verbatim}
\newcommand{\oddname}{{\sc SoME goOfY LonG ThiNg With an AwkWarD 
                                                NAme}\xspace}
\end{verbatim}

Then called however you defined it: \oddname.

\section{Handling a supplement}

Probably best to have chapter supplements as appendices at the end of the thesis. In the main.tex file, you will see a section called \verb+\appendix+. Below that, when you call a chapter.tex file, it will treat it as an appendix and reference the section accordingly (A.1, A.2, B.1, B.2, etc.). As an example, we can reference the Figure in the supplement (Fig.\,\ref{Another_fig}; see Chapter \ref{nextChapt} for handling figures).
