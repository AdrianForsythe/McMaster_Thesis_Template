# McMaster-Style Thesis Template

I worked from the General Thesis template on Overleaf (originally from [LaTeX Templates]("http://www.LaTeXTemplates.com") to create a McMaster-style specific format. This template follows what I understand to be the formatting requirements of McMaster. This is not a McMaster Official document, and is intended only as a starting point for thesis preparation. 

Currently, the main.tex and the .cls file are needed to have full formatting.
