\chapter{Chapter 1 Supplement} % Main appendix title

\label{Supp_chap1} % Change X to a consecutive letter; for referencing this appendix elsewhere, use \ref{AppendixX}


Here is the supplemental file for chapter 1, as an alternative to including it in the main \TeX for chapter 1. This allows the figures/table to be numbered in a different way and for the section to be listed in the table of contents differently. 


\begin{figure}[h] % put figure roughly here, will float though
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{Figs/Tree_Fig.pdf}
    \caption[Same Tree]{Same tree as before, but in the appendix!}
    \label{Another_tree}
